This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom image manipulation libraries.  After taking a picture, the image data is passed to a library (e.g., OpenCV.js) for processing. The processing may take some time, and if the Camera component is unmounted before the processing is complete, it results in a crash or unexpected behavior, usually a silent error without a helpful stack trace. This is because the library tries to access and manipulate image data associated with a component that no longer exists in the React tree.
